## Data Description

In this investigative report we will be exploring the relationship between two quantitative variables across countries/years:

-   **Coal consumption per capita (measured in tonnes oil equivalent)**

    Source: [BP Statistical Review](https://www.bp.com/statisticalreview)

-   **Infant life expectancy**

    Source: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd004/)

The data on coal consumption per capita comes from BP Statistical Review's report on global energy markets over time. The data we are interested in is the amount of coal consumption per country per year. The data set, which we downloaded from Gapminder contains countries as observations and coal consumption in a specific year as variables. We transformed the data so that coal consumption was the only variable and each observation was a country and year.

The data on infant life expectancy comes from Gapminder's own data collection from various different sources. It contains information on the life expectancy at birth in each country and year. The data set, which we downloaded from Gapminder contains countries as observations and infant life expectancy in a specific year as variables. We transformed the data so that life expectancy was the only variable and each observation was a country and year.

Finally, we combined these two data sets so that for each observation (country and year), we had coal consumption and infant life expectancy as our two variables. There were a few missing values in the data, which we ignored in our analysis.

## Hypothesis

We hypothesize that infant life expectancy will have a negative association with coal consumption after adjusting for year. This is because burning coal releases many by products into the atmosphere that form toxic chemicals, and "continuous inhalation of these hazardous substances triggers many diseases such respiratory and cardiovascular disease, systemic inflammation, and neurodegeneration"  [@Gasparotto_Da_Boit_Martinello_2021]. However, with the elimination of a lot of the infectious disease deaths that affected young children and the better understanding of treading cardiovascular conditions and cancer, life expectancy has drastically increased each year [@Crimmins_2015]. Therefore, we will have to adjust for this effect in our analysis to see if there is a negative association between coal consumption and infant life expectancy like we expect.

  mutate(log_mean_coal = log(mean_coal),
         log_mean_infant = log(mean_infant))

p <- lex_coal_cont |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = log_mean_coal, 
                       y = log_mean_infant, 
                       label = country,

                                     "<br>"))) +

  ) +
  labs(x = "Log Mean Coal Consumption (tonnes oil equivalent)",
       y = "Log Infant Life Expectancy (years)",
       title = "Infant Life Expectancy vs Coal Consumption by Country") + theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
                                                                                plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text") |>
  layout(
    margin = list(t = 120),
    title = list(
      text = "Infant Life Expectancy vs Coal Consumption by Country",

      x = 0.5,               
      xanchor = "center"     
    )
  )
```

The above graph shows the relationship between mean coal consumption and mean infant life expectancy. We can see that a 2-fold increase in the mean coal consumption per capita is associated with an increase in the predicted mean infant life expectancy by a factor of 1.012. Additionally, we can see that on average, the mean infant life expectancy in Oceania, Europe and the Americas is higher than the mean infant life expectancy in Asia and Africa. Finally, we can see that South Africa appears to be an outlier, with one of the highest observed mean coal consumption per capita but the lowest mean infant life expectancy.

The above graph shows that over time, both the infant life expectancy and coal consumpiton per capita has increased in all countries. We can see a big increase in coal consumption per capita across many Asian countries.

## Linear Regression Models

We used a linear regression model to predict the log mean infant life expectancy (years) form the log mean coal consumption per capita (tonnes oil equivalent).

```{r}

model <- lm(log_mean_infant ~ log_mean_coal, data = lex_coal_cont)
coefs <- broom::tidy(model)

knitr::kable(
  coefs,
  digits  = 3,
  caption = "Regression Coefficients\n(log Mean Infant Life Expectancy ∼ log Mean Coal Consumption)",
  col.names = c("Term", "Estimate", "Standard Error", "t value", "p value")
) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

**Variance Summary**

```{r}
var_response <- var(lex_coal_cont$log_mean_infant)
var_fitted <- var(fitted(model))
var_residuals <- var(residuals(model))
r_squared <- var_fitted / var_response
summary_table <- tibble(
  Metric = c("Variance of Response (A)", 
             "Variance of Fitted Values (B)", 
             "Variance of Residuals", 
             "Model R² (B/A)"),
  Value = c(var_response, var_fitted, var_residuals, r_squared)
)

summary_table |>
  kable(format = "html", digits = 4, caption = "Regression Model Variance Summary") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F)
```

**Analysis**

In our model, our R-squared value is 0.2042. As a result, approximately 20.4% of the variance in log mean infant mortality rate is explained by the variance in log mean coal consumption per capita. Since our p value is below 0.05, we are able to say that the relationship between infant mortality rate and coal exposure is statistically significant. In conclusion, our model explains about one fifth of the variability in infant mortality.

**Improved Model**

To investigate the effect of the progression of medical technology and its effect on year, we add the variable year to our model.

```{r}

model <- lm(log(infant_lex) ~ log(coal_cons_per_cap) + year, 
            data = lex_coal |> filter(coal_cons_per_cap != 0))
coefs <- broom::tidy(model)

knitr::kable(
  coefs,
  digits  = 3,
  caption = "Regression Coefficients\n(log Mean Infant Life Expectancy ∼ log Mean Coal Consumption)",
  col.names = c("Term", "Estimate", "Standard Error", "t value", "p value")
) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```

**Variance Summary**

```{r}
var_response <- var(lex_coal_cont$log_mean_infant)
var_fitted <- var(fitted(model))
var_residuals <- var(residuals(model))
r_squared <- var_fitted / var_response
summary_table <- tibble(
  Metric = c("Variance of Response (A)", 
             "Variance of Fitted Values (B)", 
             "Variance of Residuals", 
             "Model R² (B/A)"),
  Value = c(var_response, var_fitted, var_residuals, r_squared)
)

summary_table |>
  kable(format = "html", digits = 4, caption = "Regression Model Variance Summary") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F)
```

**Analysis**

In our new model, our R-squared value is 0.7185. As a result, approximately 71.85% of the variance in log infant mortality rate is explained by the variance in log coal consumption per capita and year. Since our p value is below 0.05, we are able to say that the relationship between infant mortality rate and coal exposure is statistically significant. In conclusion, our model explains about one fifth of the variability in infant mortality.

## Cross Validation

**Performing the Validation**
```{r}
set.seed(2025)

# determine number of folds
n <- nrow(lex_coal_cont)
k <- floor(n / 10)

# assign rows to folds randomly
fold_id <- sample(rep(1:k, length.out = n))

#function for fitting
compute_fold_r2 <- function(fold, data, fold_id) {
  train_df <- data[fold_id != fold, ]
  test_df  <- data[fold_id == fold, ]
  mod      <- lm(log_mean_infant ~ log_mean_coal, data = train_df)
  preds    <- predict(mod, newdata = test_df)
  var(preds) / var(test_df$log_mean_infant)
}

# perform the cross validation
cv_results <- tibble(fold = 1:k) |>
  mutate(
    r2 = map_dbl(fold, compute_fold_r2,
                 data = lex_coal_cont,
                 fold_id = fold_id)
  )

cv_results |>
  kable(format = "html", digits = 4, caption = "K Fold R-Squared Values") |>
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F)
```

**Visualization**
```{r}
mean_r2 <- mean(cv_results$r2)

ggplot(cv_results, aes(x = r2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.02, color = "black", fill = "lightblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_r2, linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Cross-Validated R^2 Values",
    subtitle = paste0("k = ", k, " folds; mean R² = ", round(mean_r2, 3)),
    x = expression(R^2),
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

## Conclusion

While the estimated slope coefficient of coal log consumption per capita is smaller in our second model than in our first model, it is still positive. This indicates that an increase in coal consumption leads to an increase in predicted infant life expectancy. This goes against what we hypothesized, though we suspect that the reason for the discrepancy is confounding variables like GDP. More analysis is needed to understand why coal consumption per capita is associated with an increase in infant life expectancy.
